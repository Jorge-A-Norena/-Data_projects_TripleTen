# Final Project: Business Problem

## Problem Description:

You've been hired as a junior analyst for Zomato. Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. As your first assignment in the onboarding process you’re given several test datasets to analyze the business performance of restaurants and customers registered in the service.

The BI-Analytics Team in Zomato usually performs 3 types of analysis:

1. **Customer Analysis Segmentation**: Who are Zomato’s customers? What segments can we split them into? What is their purchasing behavior?
2. **Restaurant Analysis**: What restaurants are popular? What restaurants generate the highest revenue? Why?
3. **Sales Analysis**: Dynamics of sales/revenue overtime, main KPIs, change in distribution of sales and so on.

Your Team Lead expects you to perform one type of the analysis as well. Choose 1 out of the 3 areas to focus on and build your research plan. At the end of your onboarding process, you should present the dashboard related to the area as well as the main key points of your analysis in the format of a report or presentation.

## Data

### Zomato data.zip

Download the archive with the test data given by your Team Lead. You’ll find 5 tables there:

- `food`
- `menu`
- `orders`
- `restaurant`
- `users`

It should be more than enough for you to complete your onboarding assignment, there is no need to use additional information. You may use one or several tables from the database, depending on your goal. You may join the data as you wish.
