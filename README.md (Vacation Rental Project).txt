## Project Overview

In this report we will be analysing the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. We will be recommending optimal properties for investment using data collected from current Airbnb listings in the targeted area. In our analysis we will be taking into account certain assumptions, as well as the clients preferences and interests. 

## Findings and Conclusion

There are 10 neighborhoods with the most reviews in the past 12 months; Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, and Upper East Side. - (Pivot 1)

Lower East Side is the neighborhood with the most reviews in the last 12 months and will be our target neighborhood

Overall the most popular size listing for the top 10 neighborhoods are one bedroom properties. With the exception of Midtown at 64.39% for Studio apartments, and Hells Kitchen 47.89% for 2 Bedroom apartments, the other eight neighborhoods have one bedrooms as their most popular rental. Lower East Side has 86.96% of its listings as one bedrooms making it the neighborhood with the most one bedroom listings in our top 10 neighborhoods. - (Pivot 2)

The highest occupancy days for listing are Fridays and Saturdays, with 86.41% and 86.05% respectively. Mondays at 79.75% and Tuesdays at 79.95% are the days with the lowest average for occupancy rate. - (Pivot 4)

Properties with a review rating of 4.8 or above, and between $150 to $300 per night rate are preferred. Also, properties with fewer than 52 reviews in the last 12 months should be considered less active therefore not prefered

Once the listings were filtered by preferred occupancy rate and potential revenue, four listings in Lower East Side met the criteria for investment. Listings id; 51687864, 52634002, 51681375, and 51410905 (copy of Processed Data Listings)

Analysis shows; that based on the expected occupancy rate for our preferred neighborhood of Lower East Side, one particular listing stands out. Listing id 51687864 has a 4.85 review rating, 53 reviews over the past 12 months, and an occupancy rate of 86.21% at 365 days should give this property a projected annual revenue of $84,012. - (Pivot 5)

Superhosts in Chelsea have a significantly lower estimated annual revenue compared with non-superhosts, about a $23,000 difference. On the contrary Lower East Side superhosts have an estimated annual revenue that is about $28,000 higher than non-superhosts. - (Pivot 7)

Host that offer instant booking in East Village, Lower East Side, and Upper West Side have higher occupancy rates than hosts that don't. - (Pivot 8)

Buildings with doormen have slightly better review scores for check-in. - (Pivot 9)

Hosts can charge higher prices for higher review ratings. This is evident when we look at the average price for our top 10 neighborhoods compared to the average review score rating. - (Pivot 10)
