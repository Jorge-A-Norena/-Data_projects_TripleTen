## CONVERSION FUNNEL

The website received 10,453 unique visitors. Of these, 29% added items to their shopping carts, amounting to 3,036 carts. Furthermore, 36% of these users completed a purchase, resulting in 1,081 products sold.

## RETENTION RATES

The analysis focused on retention rates using purchase activity data. Cohorts were categorized based on month intervals, resulting in six groups from September 2020 to January 2021. Septgember cohort spanning six days, had a 12.5% retention rate after one month, dropping to 6.25% after two months. The October cohort showed a 7.49% retention rate after one month, decreasing to 0.53% by the fourth month. Overall, a consistent decline in retention rates was observed across all cohorts, with the 1-month rate being the highest and the 2, 3, and 4-month rates showing a steady decrease.
