# SPRINT 2: DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE (SQL)

In this project we have been tasked with analyzing competitor data and testing a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

We were tasked with working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Our task was to find patterns in the available information. We had  to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

Working with a database, we analyzed data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.
