## CONCLUSION 

Conclusion
Zomato's sales data analysis from October 2017 to June 2020 highlights several strategic opportunities to boost growth and customer engagement. By focusing marketing efforts on high-performing cities, expanding offerings in both traditional Indian and popular international cuisines, and leveraging peak ordering periods, Zomato can capitalize on existing trends. Targeted promotions for key demographics such as students, single-person households, and specific age groups, along with initiatives to increase family and employee engagement, can further drive sales. Addressing periods of decline with strategic promotions and understanding the underlying factors can help maintain consistent performance. Implementing these recommendations will enable Zomato to enhance its market presence, cater to diverse customer preferences, and achieve sustained growth in the competitive food delivery industry.
